# Sprint 1 &ndash; Intro to Java

## Starts Wednesday, 9/30
## Deliverables and quiz are due on Wednesday, 10/14

## Overview and Goals
This sprint will introduce two important features of Java that we'll be using for the rest of the class: loops and arrays.

- The `while` and `for` loops.
- One-dimensional arrays, including creation, indexing elements, and using loops to access arrays.
- An intro to two-dimensional arrays.

All of these features (with the possible exception of 2-D arrays) are similar to things we used in the previous class, but there are several
differences between Java's loop and array implementations and Python's `for` loop and lists.

As in the previous sprint, you'll have four things to complete by the due date:

1. The deliverables described in this project.
2. An individual quiz.
3. A short individual reflective write-up.
4. Reading from the ZyBook.

## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the problems in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work freely with the members of your team and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas.

The quiz and reflective write-up will be done **online** on **Wednesday, October 14**, which will also be the release day for the next sprint's material. The quiz will be 
**individual** (not team) but will be **open everything**: you can use the sprint resources, your notes, and online resources. Remember to abide by the Honor Code 
and ask me if you have questions about what is an acceptable resource.

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapters 4 and 5 of the ZyBook. You don't need to complete the challenge questions or any sections that are marked as optional.

## Java Features

At the end of this sprint, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Writing a `while` loop with a guard variable.

- Using a `while` loop to repeatedly prompt for input until the user enters a valid value.

- Testing for `String` equality using `equals` and the difference between that method and the `==` operator.

- Using a `for` loop to iterate through a range of numbers.

- Using `for` loops and `if-else` statements to find numbers satisfying certain properties.

- Declaring 1-D arrays.

- Accessing array elements.

- Using a loop to print the elements of an array, find the max or min value, sum the elements, initialize an array to a starting value, or perform other
similar operations.

- The differences between Java arrays and Python's lists.

- Declaring and accessing 2-D arrays.

- Using a pair of loops to print the elements of a 2-D array.

- The selection sort algorithm and its implementation using a pair of loops.

## Schedule and Tips

We will work through examples and answer questions every day in class. In addition to the class work, the following schedule will help your groups stay on track.

- Start with the `while` loop examples, which focus on using a loop to read input. Make sure you understand how to write a loop that repeatedly prompts for input until
the user enters a value that matches a particular criteria of interest.

- Then focus on Java's `for` loop, which has a very different syntax from Python's `for`. Your first goal is the write `for` loops that can count through a range and use
that ability to solve some basic number selection problems, like the FizzBuzz and Project Euler examples.

- Look at the Staircase and Pyramid examples, which show you how to combine multiple loops, counting variables, and printing to produce structured output. These will help
you do the second problem.

- The third problem (the Subtraction Game) is more complex, but doesn't require any new features.

- For the last problem (Nim), you'll need to combine the idea of using loops to get valid input with a 1-D array that represents the state of the game. This is a fairly complex
program with a larger number of variables that our first examples, so start looking at it as soon as we've gone over 1-D arrays.

- You don't have any problems using 2-D arrays yet, but we'll keep using them in the next unit and you'll need them for the next project.

As you're working, remember:

- You're allowed to work collaboratively with members of your group and you can use any other online resources that you find useful.

- **Don't wait until the last minute**. You won't have enough time to finish everything.
