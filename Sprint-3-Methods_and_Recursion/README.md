# Sprint 3 &ndash; Methods and Recursion

## Starts Wednesday, 10/14
## Deliverables and quiz are due on Wednesday, 10/28

## Overview and Goals
This sprint will review the use of methods in Java, including passing arguments and returning values, and introduce **recursion**, one of the most
important concepts in computer science that you'll see over and over again in your future classes.

As in the previous sprint, you'll have four things to complete by the due date:

1. The deliverables described in this project.
2. An individual quiz.
3. A short individual reflective write-up.
4. Reading from the ZyBook.

## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the problems in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work freely with the members of your team and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas.

The quiz and reflective write-up will be done **online** on **Wednesday, October 28**, which will also be the release day for the next sprint's material. The quiz will be 
**individual** (not team) but will be **open everything**: you can use the sprint resources, your notes, and online resources. Remember to abide by the Honor Code 
and ask me if you have questions about what is an acceptable resource.

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapters 6 and 7 of the ZyBook, on methods and recursion. You don't need to complete the challenge questions or any sections that are marked as optional.

## Java Features

At the end of this sprint, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Writing `static` methods.

- Passing arguments to static methods and returning values.

- Java's rules of variable scoping and the concept of local variables. The concepts of the stack and the heap as locations where variables may be stored in memory.

- Defining the base and recursive cases of a recursive method. Implementing recursive methods.

- Using a stack diagram to reason about what happens in a sequence of method calls.


## Schedule and Tips

We will work through examples and answer questions every day in class. In addition to the class work, the following schedule will help your groups stay on track.

- Start with the method examples. It often takes some time to understand the process of calling a method, passing in arguments, and returning a value. Work through the
examples until you're comfortable with methods that take inputs and return values. After we go through a few examples, I'll be assuming that you're okay with code that
uses methods for organization, rather than putting everyting in `main`.

- Look at the recursion examples. The most important thing to understand about these early recursive problems is the concept of the recursive case (where the method
calls itself) and the base case (where the method doesn't call itself and just returns immediately). For each example, pay attention to how the base and recursive 
cases are implemented.

- If you need to see more examples of methods and recursion, take a look at the chapters in [*Think Java*](https://greenteapress.com/thinkjava7/html/) by Allen Downey, 
which is available free on the Web.

As you're working, remember:

- You're allowed to work collaboratively with members of your group and you can use any other online resources that you find useful.

- **Don't wait until the last minute**. You won't have enough time to finish everything.
