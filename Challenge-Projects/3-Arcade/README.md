# Challenge Project &ndash; Arcade

## Due December 11

## Description

This project is simple: use `StdDraw.java` and object-oriented programming concepts to make your own implementation of any 2-D game. There are any number of ideas that you
could pursue, like *Space Invaders* or *Centipede*.

Below, I've given you some starting instructions and code to for a version of *Pac-Man* that you can use as a starting point if you don't have any other game that you want
 to work on. Regardless of the game you pick, the key requirements are:

- Use an object-oriented style. Do not access any object properties directly from `main`! All object instance variables must be `private` and accessed through appropriate methods.

- Use classes to describe each game element: the player, the enemies, blocks or walls, etc.

- Use `StdDraw` for 2-D graphics. You can use basic geometric shapes for everything.

- Write a complete game, with a way for the player to win and a way to lose. **Simplify as much as you need to** and then add more features once you have a basic working game.

- Your game doesn't have to be as complex as our in-class examples, since you're working out most of the design on your own.

More tips:

- Develop incrementally! Write a little bit and then test.

- *Tetris* is a cool game, but is hard to program. Choose it if you really want a challenge.

- 

The rest of this write-up describes the *Pac-Man* project. If you want to make your own game, you can use all of our previous game examples to help you, but you ultimately have to work out the design yourself (that's why it's a challenge project).

### Overview
*Pac-Man*, the grandaddy-of-them-all and greatest-of-all-time eat-'em-up arcade game. Here's a refresher if you need one:
