# Sprint 4 &ndash; Objects and Classes

## Starts Wednesday, 10/28
## Deliverables and quiz are due on Wednesday, 11/11

## Overview and Goals
This unit will introduce one of the most important concepts in software engineering: **object-oriented programming**. You might remember that we worked with objects and classes
briefly in Python, but their role in Java is much more fundamental to the entire nature and strucure of the language.

By the end of this unit, you'll be familiar with several important topics related to OOP in Java:

- Creating your own classes with instance variables and methods.

- Writing constructor methods.

- Access modifiers for data and methods.

- Using classes to organize your programs.

- Writing graphical programs using a drawing library.


## Deliverables and Quiz

Complete the project in `Deliverables`. Remember that you may work freely with the members of your team and you may use any resources that you find helpful to
complete the project. Put each program into its own `.java` file, then put all of your files into a ZIP archive and submit them through the assignment posted to Canvas.

The quiz and reflective write-up will be done **online** on **Wednesday, October 28**, which will also be the release day for the next sprint's material. The quiz will be 
**individual** (not team) but will be **open everything**: you can use the sprint resources, your notes, and online resources. Remember to abide by the Honor Code 
and ask me if you have questions about what is an acceptable resource.

## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapter 8 of the ZyBook, on objects and classes. You don't need to complete the challenge questions or any sections that are marked as optional. Note that this is a pretty long chapter, which also inclues some material about `ArrayList` that we'll use in future examples.

## Java Features

At the end of this sprint, you should be comfortable with the following Java features:

- Creating your own classes to represent "things" in your program.

- Adding instance variables and methods to your classes.

- Java's access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default access modifier.

- Writing and calling constructor methods.

- Using a "driver" class to serve as the `main` for a program.

- Creating a moderately large program using object-oriented principles.

- Using the `StdDraw` library to create graphical programs and games.


## Schedule and Tips

We'll start working on the early examples in class. The main goal of this unit is to understand the idea of an object as a "thing" that represents something important in the
program and can have its own properties and behaviors. Our goal in the first part of the unit will be to build up to the `Card` and `Deck` examples, which will enable you to 
work on the main deliverable assignment for this unit.

Once we've gotten past those, we'll start working on graphical programs using the `StdDraw.java` class. There are three labs in the `Examples` directory:

- The first one uses graphics and objects to create a bouncing ball. The key idea of this program is understanding how objects can be a useful way to organize the variables
associated with each item in your graphical program.

- The second one introduces keyboard input and collision detection.

- The third guides you through writing a Pong game.
