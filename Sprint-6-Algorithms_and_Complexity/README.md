# Sprint 6 &ndash; Algorithms and Complexity

## Due December 18

## Description

This is it, the last sprint. Our goal for this unit is to gain an introduction to some of the most important concepts in computer science: Computational complexity analysis
and Big-O notation.

Complexity analysis refers to methods of analyzing the performance of algorithms in a way that doesn't depend on experimental evaluation. It is an abstract concept of
a computer program's performance that is independent of any particular CPU or system and focuses on how the performance of an algorithm will scale as the input size
increases. The main role of complexity analysis is to allow programmers to make relative comparisons and decide which algorithms are "better" and which are "worse".

At the end of this sprint you'll be familiar with the following concepts:

- Searching a list or array using linear search or binary search

- The concept of order of growth applied to mathematical functions

- The formal definition of Big-O notation notation

- Estimating the complexity of algorithms by analyzing their pseudocode

- Simple sorting algorithms &ndash; selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort &ndash; and the arguments that they are all O(*n*<sup>2</sup>)

- Practical O(*n* lg *n*) divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms: Quick sort and merge sort


## Reading

Complete the **participation questions** for Chapter 17 of the ZyBook on searching, sorting, and Big-O notation.

## Deliverables

Complete the questions in `Deliverables.md`. These are all written problems letting you practice working with Big-O notation and algorithm design concepts.
